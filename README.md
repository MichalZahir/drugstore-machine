## Your task is to implement the following features:
* The machine can be filled with products e.q. add 3 times the "Balea shower gel" to the machine
* Customers can buy products and the machine calculates the total price e.q. a user wants to buy 3 times the "Balea shower gel" and 1 time thr "SEINZ beard oil" the total price is 3 * 0,55 € + 1 * 7,95 € = 9,60 €
* You can only buy as many products as there are in the machine

The business logic should be implemented in the backend project witten in Java with Spring Boot. Every feature should have a simple frontend representation. The frontend should be implemented in React.
